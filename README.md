### Project #3: Build Data Dashboards

**Objective:** Design and construct interactive data dashboards using Tableau, which serve as a medium to unveil and narrate data-driven stories.

**Description:** 
In the modern era, data storytelling is of paramount importance. Recognizing this, the project was an endeavor to harness the power of Tableau to build interactive dashboards. These dashboards, intricately designed, were more than mere visualsâ€”they were narratives, tales waiting to be told, insights waiting to be discovered.
